OCR From Scratch on MNIST Dataset
Hey everyone! This project is a basic version of Optical Character Recognition (OCR). It's built on the previously uploaded repository Neural Network from Scratch (nnfs) which is a practical implementation of Neural Networks to identify handwritten numbers from the well-known MNIST Dataset.

Overview
The project demonstrates the implementation of Neural Networks from Scratch for classifying handwritten digits using Forward Propagation, Backward Propagation, Activation Function, Loss Function, and Optimization methods. The dataset utilized is the MNIST Dataset.
